# About the Project
The Train Reservation System is a comprehensive backend solution to manage train schedules, seat availability, bookings, and cancellations. It incorporates optimized database queries to ensure fast and reliable operations while maintaining scalability for growing datasets.

# Features
1) Train Search and Scheduling:

* Users can search for trains based on boarding/destination stations and travel dates.
* Implements date and day-of-week-based filtering for dynamic schedules.

2)  Seat Availability:

* Real-time seat availability checking based on user criteria like train class and quota.
* Supports limiting results for user-friendly responses.

3)  Booking and Payments:

* Handles ticket booking, fare calculation, and payment processing securely.
* Includes seat assignment and waitlist handling.

4) Cancellations and Refunds:

* Allows users to cancel tickets and get refunds based on policies.
* Optimizes seat reallocation for waitlisted passengers.

5) Optimized Database Queries:

* Efficient joins and filtering to minimize computation time and resource consumption.
* Supports scalability by reducing intermediate data processing.

# Impact

* Improved query performance by up to 50% with heuristic-based optimizations.
* Reduced memory consumption and execution time, enabling smooth operation for large datasets.
* Scalable design to handle increased user queries and train records.
